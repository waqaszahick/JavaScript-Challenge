# JavaScript-Challenge
Assignment # 13: JavaScript

This is my overall 13th, and first JavaScript assignment. I was required to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon pre-provided database i.e. “UFO Sightings Data”. I was also required to allow the users to filter the table data for specific values using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.
This is a 2-level assignment and I performed the following tasks in ‘Level-1 (Automatic Table and Date Search)":
* Created a basic HTML web page i.e. “index.html”.
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
	- Made sure of having a column for “Date / Time”, “City”, “State”, “Country”, “Shape”, and “Comment”.
* Used a “date” form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the “Date / Time” column to find rows that match user input.

In “Level-2 (Multiple Search Categories)", I performed the following tasks:
* Completed all of “Level 1” criteria.
* Using multiple input tags and / or “select” dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
1. Date / Time
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape
